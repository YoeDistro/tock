The [Raspberry Pi Pico 2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/) is a
board developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and is based on the RP2350 chip.

## Getting Started

First, follow the [Tock Getting Started guide](../../doc/Getting_Started.md)

## Installing picotool

The RP2350 uses UF2 files for flashing. Tock compiles to an ELF file. The
`picotool` utility is needed to transform the Tock ELF file into an UF2 file.

To install `picotool`, check the instructions from their GitHub
[page](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool).


## Flashing the kernel

The Raspberry Pi Pico 2 RP2350 Connect can be programmed using its bootloader,
which requires an UF2 file.

### Configure the local board with Tockloader

The Pico 2 bootloader can only flash a single file at a fixed address. So we
need to create a combined file that includes the kernel and apps. To configure
Tockloader to do this, run

```bash
$ make init
```

### Enter BOOTSEL mode

To flash the Pico RP2350, it needs to be put into BOOTSEL mode. This will mount
a flash drive that allows one to copy a UF2 file. To enter BOOTSEL mode, press
the BOOTSEL button and hold it while you connect the other end of the micro USB
cable to your computer.

Then `cd` into `boards/raspberry_pi_pico_2` directory and run:

```bash
$ make program
```

> Note: The Makefile provides the BOOTSEL_FOLDER variable that points towards
> the mount point of the Pico 2 RP2350 flash drive. By default, this is located
> in `/media/$(USER)/RP2350`. This might be different on several systems, make
> sure to adjust it.

## Installing apps

Enter BOOTSEL mode.

Apps are built out-of-tree. Once an app is built,
install it with tockloader:

```
$ tockloader install
```

Because of the `make init` step above, this will install the app to the local
file.

To install the kernel and apps to the board:

```
$ make program
```

## Debugging

The Raspberry Pi Pico can also be programmed via an SWD connection, which
requires the Pico to be connected to a regular Raspberry Pi device that exposes
the necessary pins OR using another Raspberry Pi Pico set up in “Picoprobe”
mode. The kernel is transferred to the Raspberry Pi Pico using a [custom version
of OpenOCD](https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd).

### Flashing Setup

#### From a regular Raspberry Pi (option 1)

To install OpenOCD on the Raspberry Pi run the following commands on the Pi:
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install automake autoconf build-essential texinfo libtool libftdi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev git
$ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd.git --recursive --branch sdk-2.0.0 --depth=1
$ cd openocd
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --enable-ftdi --enable-sysfsgpio --enable-bcm2835gpio
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
```

Enable SSH on the Raspberry Pi by following the [instructions on the Raspberry
Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/).

Next, connect the SWD pins of the Pico 2 (the tree lower wires) to GND, GPIO 24,
and GPIO 25 of the Raspberry Pi. You can follow the schematic in the
[official documentation](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A22%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C115%2C431.757%2Cnull%5D)
and connect the blue, black, and purple wires.

Also connect the other three wires as shown in the schematic, which will connect
the Pico UART to the Raspberry Pi. This will enable the serial communication
between the two devices.

#### From a Linux Host using a Picoprobe (option 2)

To install OpenOCD on Debian/Ubuntu run the following commands:
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install automake autoconf build-essential texinfo libtool libftdi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev git
$ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd.git --recursive --branch sdk-2.0.0 --depth=1
$ cd openocd
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --enable-picoprobe
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
```

Download the Picoprobe UF2 file onto the USB mass storage device presented by
the Pico that is going to act as Picoprobe device after plugging it into some
USB port: https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/soft/picoprobe.uf2 (the device
should automatically restart after the file has been written).

Next, connect the SWD pins of the Pico 2 target (the tree lower wires,
left-to-right) to GP2, GND, and GP3 of the Pico that will act as Picoprobe. You
can follow the schematic in the
[official documentation](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A64%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C115%2C696.992%2Cnull%5D)
and connect the blue, black, and purple wires.

Also connect the other four wires as shown in the schematic, which will connect
the Pico UART and power to the Picoprobe. This will enable the serial
communication between the two devices.

### Flashing the tock kernel

#### Building and Deploying from the same System

`cd` into `boards/raspberry_pi_pico` directory and run:

```bash
$ make flash OPENOCD_INTERFACE=[swd|picoprobe]
```

The *OPENOCD_INTERFACE* parameter selects which mode to flash the target Pico
device in: `swd` flashes directly via SWD over GPIO (default, needs to be run a
regular Raspberry Pi), `picoprobe` flashes indirectly via another Raspberry Pi
Pico device.

You can also open a serial console on to view debug messages:
```bash
$ sudo apt install picocom
$ picocom /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200 -l
```

#### Building on a Desktop/Laptop then Flashing via regular Raspberry Pi

`cd` into `boards/raspberry_pi_pico_2` directory and run:

```bash
$ make
```

Connect via ssh to the Raspberry Pi and forward port 3333. Then start OpenOCD on
the Pi.

```bash
$ ssh pi@<pi_IP> -L 3333:localhost:3333

(wait to connect)

$ openocd -f interface/raspberrypi-swd.cfg -f target/rp2350.cfg
```

You can also open a serial console on the Raspberry Pi for debug messages.

```bash
$ sudo apt install minicom
$ minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/serial0
```

On the local computer use gdb-multiarch on Linux or arm-none-eabi-gdb on MacOS
to deploy tock.

```bash
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb tock/target/thumbv8m.main-none-eabi/release/raspberry_pi_pico_2.elf
(gdb) target remote :3333
(gdb) load
(gdb) continue
```
